For the first time in more than a decade, New Zealand house prices recorded a quarterly drop. ANZ economists say the mood in the market has shifted – from “fear of missing out” to “I’m not paying that”. We’re eager to hear from our New Zealand readers on how this might be affecting you. For buyers – lower prices should spell good news, but are increased cost of living, inflation, or the possibility of rising interest rates making you reconsider or delay a purchase? Are you holding out to see if prices drop further? What are your hopes or concerns for the market?\nFor sellers – how are you experiencing the shift in the market? Have you struggled to sell your home, or experienced delays in selling? And for those who have recently bought – how is the prospect of rising interest rates affecting you? We’d love to hear your thoughts.
