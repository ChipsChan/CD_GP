It’s 11pm in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: France’s prestigious Bayeux War Correspondents’ Awards on Saturday largely honoured reporting on the Ukraine conflict, with Associated Press and Burkina Faso newspaper Sidwaya among the recipients. The photo prize went to Ukrainian photographer Evgeniy Maloletka for his work with video journalist Mstyslav Chernov on the fall of Mariupol for AP. The death toll from Russia’s attack on Zaporizhzhia has increased to 19, Ukrinform reports. According to the outlet, the body of the 19th victim was discovered underneath the rubble on Saturday. The Ukrainian GDP has shrunk by 30% in nine months, the ministry of economy announced on Saturday. “Among the negative factors that affected the economy, the weather and the actions of the occupiers stand out. Due to prolonged rainy weather in some regions in September, the pace of grain crop harvesting slowed down, which negatively affected the volume of harvested products,” the ministry said. An adviser to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy posted a message on Twitter saying the explosion which damaged Russia’s road-and-rail bridge to Crimea was just “the beginning”. “Everything illegal must be destroyed, everything that is stolen must be returned to Ukraine, everything occupied by Russia must be expelled,” Mykhailo Podolyak wrote. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom, warned the diesel generators at Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant only have a limited supply of fuel at present. Overnight shelling cut power to the plant, which needs cooling to avoid a meltdown, forcing it to switch to emergency generators. Ukraine is “very lucky” to have friends across Scotland, delegates at the SNP annual party conference have been told. Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko addressed delegates in Aberdeen on Saturday, where she thanked the people of Scotland for providing humanitarian aid and taking in refugees from her country during the Russian invasion.
